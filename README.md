**Enigma Machine Simulator**

To run the application, navigate to the Enigma.jar file (out/artifacts/Enigma_jar).

The main code is within src/com/foster.

The aim of this project was to create an Enigma machine simulator. It is a tool for users to encrypt and decrypt their own messages, that simulates the functionality of the Enigma I machine. It replicates the machineâ€™s encryption process, using the customisable plugboard, three rotors and reflector components, in order to encrypt a plaintext letter into ciphertext, and vice-versa. 

The report describes the details of how Java and Swing were used to create a graphical user interface application that supports the full component configuration of the original machine.
